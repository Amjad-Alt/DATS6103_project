<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Restaurants play a crucial role in a nation’ s economy and culture. Most of us have visited at least once, a variety of purposes. Given the recent increase in food trucks and popup restaurants, it is essential for the business owners to carefully consider the timing and location of new restaurant openings, as this requires a significant investment of resources. The rapidly changing business environment in the restaurant industry, characterized by the introduction of diverse restaurants with unique features and themes, presents both opportunities and challenges for restaurant owners. The strong growth of the food and beverage sector in various parts of the world has resulted in increased competition among restaurant business owners, highlighting the need for them to be well-prepared in all aspects of their operations, including concept, product innovation, and operational systems. One of the reasons for the growth of the restaurant industry is that the current food and beverage industry, particularly this restaurant, promises enormous profits and views people’s need to eat and drink as a basic necessity that must be met in order to exist. This is a chance that can be used as a successful business opportunity. It makes sense that there are so many restaurants with a variety of concepts, operational methods, and creativity with diverse product developments that showcase what these establishments have to offer to draw clients or notions that can be displayed to customers.</p>
<p>Knowing the consumer’s preferences, their purchasing habits with regard to the products they frequently purchase, and their product purchase patterns, which can be seen through purchase transaction data, are all necessary for developing the right sales strategy and creating the right target promotion. Data mining techniques can be used to extract information from stored transaction data in order to create new data or data patterns. For instance, data to determine the sales trends in relation to the menu association rules. A priori algorithm, also known as market basket analysis, is a technique that may be used to examine customer purchasing behavior and generate association rules using the “if then” pattern.</p>

<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> SMART Questions</h1>
<p>With the intention of focusing the project to raise the profit of an Indian takeaway restaurant by giving marketing suggestions of association supported by data, we focused on recent data for Indian takeaway restaurant’s dataset placed in London, UK . In particular, we inquired into to two aspects of Indian restaurant which is given below:</p>
<p>Quantity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the most ordered product?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the least ordered product?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the quantity of product ordered each day, week, year?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Profit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the average profit of the day, week, year?</p></li>
<li><p>How to raise the profit by using role of association?</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="literature-review" class="level1" data-number="3">
<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Literature Review</h1>
<p>According to information we got from customer feedback, prior research in this area was primarily concerned with the impact of menu design, staff training and marketing efforts (Kang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Luo &amp; Xu., 2021). There is still a need for further research on the most effective methods for collecting and utilizing customers’ collected information.</p>
<p>Recent research has focused on how to predict sales patterns utilizing data mining-based analysis, such as market basket analysis. Studies like those that (Aditiya Hermawan and Riki, 2019) took a step further by working to suggest various combinations of items based on the likelihood of their occurence in the data which can help in the restaurant profit by applying Association of items at the O! Fish resturant.</p>
<!--
(One extensively researched area in the field of restaurant data is the use of customer reviews and ratings to improve the quality of service and overall customer experience (Kang et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Luo & Xu, 2021). While this has been shown to be valuable for informing decisions related to menu design, staff training, and marketing efforts, there is still a need for further research on the most effective methods for collecting and utilizing customers' collected information. There is a gap in research on the use of data analytics in the restaurant industry to optimize various aspects of the business, such as by examining the association between items on a restaurant's menu and the likelihood of their co-occurrence. While there has been some research on these topics, there is a need for more in-depth and comprehensive studies that assess the impact of such associations on the financial performance and competitiveness of restaurants.

<h3 data-number="5.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="apriori-algorithm"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Apriori Algorithm</h3>
<p>Apriori algorithm is a powerful tool for discovering frequent item sets in large datasets. It is based on the principle of association rule mining, which aims to identify patterns of co-occurrence among items in a dataset. By analyzing the frequency of item sets, the Apriori algorithm can uncover hidden relationships and insights that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data. It has proven to be a robust and effective method for extracting useful information, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in a wide range of fields. It has three main outputs: support, confident, and lift.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Support is a measure of the frequency of an itemset or association rule in the transaction dataset. It is calculated as the percentage of transactions in the dataset that contain the itemset or rule. For example, if the support of an association is 5%, this means that the item appears in 5% of the transactions in the dataset. Support is used to identify frequent itemsets are worth considering for further analysis. The minimum support threshold is set by the user and in this project we set it by <strong>0.0315</strong> which is <code>(number of unique items * 0.5)/ 100</code></p></li>
<li><p>Confidence is a measure of the reliability of an association rule. It is calculated as the percentage of transactions that contain the antecedent (A) of the rule that also contain the consequent (B). For example, if the rule is A =&gt; B and the confidence is 60%, this means that 60% of the transactions that contain A also contain B. Confidence is used to evaluate the quality of an association rule and determine whether it is worth considering for further analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Lift is a useful metric for identifying interesting and potentially useful associations in a dataset. If the lift for the association between A and B is 3, this means that customers are three times more likely to purchase A and B together than they would be if the two items were independent. A lift value of 1 to infinity would indicate that there is no relationship between the two items, while a lift value greater than 1 indicates a positive relationship and a lift value less than 1 indicates a negative relationship. The minimum lift threshold is set by the user and in this project we set it by <strong>1.5</strong></p></li>

<h3 data-number="5.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prepering-data"><span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Prepering data</h3>
<p>It is often necessary to classify and organize different items into categories for the purpose of analysis and comparison. One approach that is taken in this project is to treat items that are the same thing but have different flavors or variations as separate categories. However, a more effective method is to group these items under the main category of the main item name, without indicating the specific flavors or variations. Therefore items names in the list reduced from <strong>248</strong> to be <strong>63</strong>. This approach has the advantage of allowing for a more streamlined and concise organization of data, as well as reducing the potential for confusion or misunderstanding. Additionally, grouping items in this way can facilitate a more holistic and comprehensive analysis of the data, as it allows for a more integrated and comprehensive view of the relationships between different items.</p>
<p>On consumer behavior and purchasing patterns, it is often necessary to analyze data on individual receipts and the items that were purchased. One approach that has been taken is to group items under a receipt number and then convert the items into columns, with each column indicating the presence or absence of that item on the receipt. This approach allows for the creation of a matrix-like structure in which each row represents a receipt and each column represents a specific item. This type of organization is useful because it allows for the efficient analysis of data on multiple receipts at once, as well as facilitating the identification of trends and patterns in consumer behavior.</p>

<p>The results of the Apriori algorithm on the data set of the restaurant showed that there were <strong>326</strong> association rules that emerged. It was found that the purchase of <code>Rice, Sauce, Chutney</code> was with a <strong>87%</strong> confidence accompanied by the purchase of <code>Papadum</code>,and this combination found to be repeated <strong>6%</strong> of the total dataset. Similarly, the purchase of <code>Rice, Sauce, Naan, Chutney</code>was often accompanied by the purchase of <code>Papadum</code>. From the previous analysis, <code>Papadum</code> found to be one of the popular items in the restuarnt. However, Upon analyzing the lift value, it was found that the combination of <code>Papadum</code> had a strong association with a lift of 3, indicating that the likelihood of purchasing this combination together was 3 times greater than the likelihood of purchasing <code>Papadum</code> alone. These findings suggest that there may be underlying factors, such as complementary needs or preferences, that drive the co-occurrence of these items in the same transaction. In addition to these strong associations, the Apriori algorithm also identified several weaker associations, such as the relationship between <code>Rice, Naan</code> and <code>Masala, Papadum, Chutney</code> with a <strong>6%</strong> confidence and <strong>1.5</strong> lift. Further investigation of these weaker associations may also be valuable in understanding consumer behavior and identifying potential opportunities for product promotion or cross-selling.</p>

<h1 data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Limitations &amp; Other Considerations</h1>
<p>While the Apriori algorithm has been widely used in various applications, it has several limitations and inefficiencies that make it less competitive compared to other algorithms. One major issue is that the algorithm requires multiple scans of the database, which can negatively impact performance. As a result, the algorithm assumes that the database is stored in memory, which can lead to high memory usage. Additionally, the Apriori algorithm is relatively simple, but it may not be well-suited for situations where the list of items on the menu changes over time. Overall, it is important to consider these trade-offs and inefficiencies when deciding which algorithm to use for a particular problem.</p>

<li><p>Such research should be carried out in close collaboration with an accounting institution, such as a firm. This makes it simpler to declare that the model’s performance is represented in a real-world environment and that it genuinely helps in profit optimization, which is a further validation of the model.</p></li>
<li><p>The project should be carried out in coordination with end users, such as restaurants or supermarkets, as the model would benefit these firms in maximizing earnings and lowering losses, to facilitate the ease of adoption of this instrument.</p></li>
<li><p>More tests should be run to enhance the model’s performance. An enlarged presentation to fresh marked examples from new sales subjects can without a doubt increase the algorithm’s precision.</p></li>
<li><p>The business network should obtain expertise input from the outset of the project and address upcoming social, moral, and protection concerns that are crucial to the business sector.</p></li>

<h1 data-number="8"><span class="header-section-number">8</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>The findings of this project demonstrate that the application of the Apriori algorithm to analyze sales patterns in the context of Indian restaurant takeaways can provide valuable insights for informed promotional development strategies. - The use of item association rules in consumer purchase patterns can help restaurants identify targeted promotional strategies that may increase the number of orders for lower-selling items. For example, by promoting the purchase of a lower-selling item in combination with it is popular associated items to customers. That can potentially increase the number of orders for the lower-selling item. This approach has the potential to be more precise and targeted compared to traditional manual methods of promotion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One way that restaurants can potentially increase their profits is by offering promotions and discounts during off-peak times, such as weekdays. The analysis of customer purchasing patterns, as identified through the use of item association rules, can provide valuable insights into which menu items are frequently purchased together and could be promoted as a bundle deal. For example, a restaurant could offer a promotion where a customer who purchases a set of items can have the associated item for free. By targeting promotions at times when foot traffic is typically lower, such as weekdays, restaurants may be able to attract additional customers and boost their profits.</p></li>
<li><p>Another way that restaurants can make use of item association rules is through visual marketing, such as using appealing images of menu items that are frequently purchased together in promotional materials. This approach can help to attract the attention of potential customers and encourage them to make purchases. By identifying the most popular item combinations, restaurants can be more strategic and targeted in their visual marketing efforts, rather than simply guessing which items might look appealing together. By effectively leveraging the power of item association rules and visual marketing, restaurants may be able to increase their profits.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the use of the Apriori algorithm in data mining can be a useful tool for uncovering new and useful patterns of information that can inform business strategies and decision-making. The final result can provide a wealth of information that can be utilized to inform various aspects of a business’s operations like inform marketing and promotional strategies, menu planning, and pricing decisions.</p>

<p>There is still so much to be accomplished. The researcher will continue to gather data in order to improve the accuracy of the current model and to make it better capture hidden events. As a result, the model will be able to scale on an even plane, enabling a sizable number of individuals to use it as a service.Even individuals who lack specific knowledge will be able to start the monitoring process. Additionally, it will be simpler to expand the model’s ability to maximize server revenues and remotely deliver the results to users by using the same channel as a result.</p>
