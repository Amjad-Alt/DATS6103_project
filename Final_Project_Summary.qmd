# Introduction  
 Restaurants play a crucial role in a nation' s economy and culture. Most of us have visited at least once, a variety of purposes. Given the recent increase in food trucks and popup restaurants, it is essential for the business owners to carefully consider the timing and location of new restaurant openings, as this requires a significant investment of resources. The rapidly changing business environment in the restaurant industry, characterized by the introduction of diverse restaurants with unique features and themes, presents both opportunities and challenges for restaurant owners. The strong growth of the food and beverage sector in various parts of the world has resulted in increased competition among restaurant business owners, highlighting the need for them to be well-prepared in all aspects of their operations, including concept, product innovation, and operational systems. One of the reasons for the growth of the restaurant industry is that the current food and beverage industry, particularly this restaurant, promises enormous profits and views people’s need to eat and drink as a basic necessity that must be met in order to exist. This is a chance that can be used as a successful business opportunity. It makes sense that there are so many restaurants with a variety of concepts, operational methods, and creativity with diverse product developments that showcase what these establishments have to offer to draw clients or notions that can be displayed to customers.

 Knowing the consumer's preferences, their purchasing habits with regard to the products they frequently purchase, and their product purchase patterns, which can be seen through purchase transaction data, are all necessary for developing the right sales strategy and creating the right target promotion. Data mining techniques can be used to extract information from stored transaction data in order to create new data or data patterns. For instance, data to determine the sales trends in relation to the menu association rules. A priori algorithm, also known as market basket analysis, is a technique that may be used to examine customer purchasing behavior and generate association rules using the "if then" pattern.


# SMART Questions
With the intention of focusing the project to raise the profit of an Indian takeaway restaurant by giving marketing suggestions of association supported by data, we focused on recent data for Indian takeaway restaurant’s dataset placed in London, UK . In particular, we inquired into to two  aspects of Indian restaurant which is given below:

Quantity:

- What is the most ordered product?

- What is the least ordered product?

- What is the quantity of product ordered each day, week, year?

Profit:

- What is the average profit of the day, week, year?

- How to raise the profit by using role of association?


# Literature Review
One extensively researched area in the field of restaurant data is the use of customer reviews and ratings to improve the quality of service and overall customer experience. While this has been shown to be valuable for informing decisions related to menu design, staff training, and marketing efforts, there is still a need for further research on the most effective methods for collecting and utilizing customers' collected information. There is a gap in research on the use of data analytics in the restaurant industry to optimize various aspects of the business, such as by examining the association between items on a restaurant's menu and the likelihood of their co-occurrence. While there has been some research on these topics, there is a need for more in-depth and comprehensive studies that assess the impact of such associations on the financial performance and competitiveness of restaurants.

# Description Of Data
The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle and consists of 74,818 observations of an Indian takeaway restaurant located in London, UK, covering the period from 2015 to 2019. The dataset includes six variables, which were augmented by an additional four variables for the purposes of this study.

1.Order Number - receipt number.

2.Order Date - date and time of the order.

3.Item Name - name of the order in the menu.

4.Quantity - number of orders per item for the receipt.

5.Product Price - item price without counting the quantity.

6.Total products - total number of items per receipt.

7.Total Price​​ - total payment for a customer

8.Time - time of order placing 

9.Date -  Date of order placing

10.Day - Name of the day in the week 



# Analysis
## EDA and Graphs

## Modeling
### Apriori Algorithm
Apriori algorithm is a powerful tool for discovering frequent item sets in large datasets. It is based on the principle of association rule mining, which aims to identify patterns of co-occurrence among items in a dataset. By analyzing the frequency of item sets, the Apriori algorithm can uncover hidden relationships and insights that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data. It has proven to be a robust and effective method for extracting useful information, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners in a wide range of fields. It has three main outputs: support, confident, and lift.

1.	Support is a measure of the frequency of an itemset or association rule in the transaction dataset. It is calculated as the percentage of transactions in the dataset that contain the itemset or rule. For example, if the support of an association is 5%, this means that the item appears in 5% of the transactions in the dataset. Support is used to identify frequent itemsets are worth considering for further analysis. The minimum support threshold is set by the user and in this project we set it by **0.0315** which is `(number of unique items * 0.5)/ 100`

2.	Confidence is a measure of the reliability of an association rule. It is calculated as the percentage of transactions that contain the antecedent (A) of the rule that also contain the consequent (B). For example, if the rule is A => B and the confidence is 60%, this means that 60% of the transactions that contain A also contain B. Confidence is used to evaluate the quality of an association rule and determine whether it is worth considering for further analysis.

3.	Lift is a useful metric for identifying interesting and potentially useful associations in a dataset. If the lift for the association between A and B is 3, this means that customers are three times more likely to purchase A and B together than they would be if the two items were independent. A lift value of 1 to infinity would indicate that there is no relationship between the two items, while a lift value greater than 1 indicates a positive relationship and a lift value less than 1 indicates a negative relationship. The minimum lift threshold is set by the user and in this project we set it by **1.5**

## Results and Interpretation
Create some rules based on the outcomes of the application of the Apriori algorithm approach with association rules to the sales transaction data in an Indian restaurant. 

-If a customer ordered Madras, Chutney Items, and  Papadum would then be ordered with a 89% confidence level. 

-If a consumer ordered Butter Chicken and Papadum, Rice would then be ordered with a 95% confidence level.   

-If a consumer orders Aloo, Rice, and Curry Items, Nana would then be ordered with a 80% confidence level. 

# Limitations & Other Considerations
It is the simplest, however the database takes up a lot of memory. The menu list's items could vary over time.

# Conclusion
As a result of the study's findings, the analysis of the application to determine the sales pattern (item association rules) in the Indian restaurant Takeaways that was submitted in earlier chapters, and the data mining technique used to uncover new information patterns, it can be said that the following: 

1. The employment of a priori algorithms in the field of data mining is known to provide new, useful information patterns that may be utilized to identify sales patterns (item association rules).

2. Indian restaurants can use item association (menu) rules in consumer purchase patterns to inform their promotional development strategies based on items (menus) bought at the same time to increase sales. This application of knowing the sales pattern (item association rule) is made possible by the implementation of an a priori data mining science algorithm. 

3. Compared to applying promotional methods manually, this program generates item association rules or menu combinations in customer purchase patterns that are precise and on-target.
